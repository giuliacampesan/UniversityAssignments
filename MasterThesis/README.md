This master thesis project reached the goal of the implementation of a Multilingual Taxonomic Text Classification 
algorithm for web pages. Two Continual Learning approaches for its extension to new languages over time have been 
proposed as an alternative to plain fine-tuning and the traditional offline machine learning full training from 
scratch. The extension of the EWC algorithm to a multioutput taxonomic classifier is one of the main contribution
of this work.
This project originated as a collaboration between the University of Padua and ID Ward LTD.
