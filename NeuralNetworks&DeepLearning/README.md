This folder contains the 3 projects developed as homework for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning Master course. 
The first deals with both the regression and classification task.
The second focuses on autoencoders for images reconstruction, both traditional and variational. 
Moreover, we apply its capability of information compression to the classification task, adding a stack of dense 
layers to the encoder front-end.
Finally, the third faces with the Q-learning approach for reinforcement learning.
